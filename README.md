# Sorting Algorithm Learning Tool
A webpage with implementations of sorting algorithm shown visually using svg animated graphs. The goal is to show results of sorting algorithms a long side each marked step of its concuring algorithm, with the final panel showing the runtime of graphed on the given data overlayed by best and worst case runtime.
